Hello there!
```

Hi, welcome to my site, my name is Lachie. I'm a graduate software engineer at Honeywell. I have a passion for writing code and created this website as a grounds for practising web development and documenting my experience. Please take a look around, although you may not find much yet as this project is only just beginning!

Here is a list of what I'd like to implement for the future of this site:
1. A detailed look into past, current, and future projects I am working on in technology and multimedia.
2. A collection of journal entries cataloguing my learning and interests.
3. Provide documentation for any projects I create and release.
